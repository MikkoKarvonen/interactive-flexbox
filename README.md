# Interactive Flexbox

Do you like flexbox? I do. I created Interactive Flexbox as an easy way to play with flexboxes capabilities. All the cool features include:

- Buttons for flex-direction, flex-wrap, justify-content and align-items
- Buttons for choosing the number of shapes on screen from three to up to five
- Style box from where you can copy and paste the css to your own site
- Five cute shapes!

### Installation

If you want to try this on your own computer and even make it better you can just clone it or fork it. Alternatively you can test it [here][link].
